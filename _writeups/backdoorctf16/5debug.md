## Write-up

So they gave a 32-bit ELF stripped executable. Simply running the binary `./debug32` didn't do nothing.

I looked through the assembly in IDA and saw "Printing Flag" being printed somewhere.

So the first and probably the last thing I needed to do was to jump to the function printing it. The address of the function as we can see is at `0x804849B`.

For this I used gdb. My first instinct was to set a breakpoint at `main`, then set the `eip` to the address of the required function and continue. This would print out the flag.

But since this was a stripped binary(hence no symbols table), it didn't recognise `main` as a valid breakpoint. So I set the breakpoint at `__libc_start_main()` function. This is the function which sets up the environment and then calls the `main()` function when the binary is run.

So to carry out the required task, these were the commands I used:

~~~
break __libc_start_main

set $eip = 0x804849b

continue
~~~

This as expected printed out the flag!
