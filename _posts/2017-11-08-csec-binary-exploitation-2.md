![Binary Exploitation](/assets/images/csec.png)

The second episode of my Binary Exploitation series is out!

(The first one can be found [here](../csec-binary-exploitation-1).)

In this one I talk about some more advanced exploitation techniques, mitigation stratergies used against buffer overflow attacks and how to bypass them. There's a lot of stuff this time. Infact, it's about double the length of the previous video.

Don't miss the demo at the end!

Constructive criticism is much appreciated.

**Cheers!**
