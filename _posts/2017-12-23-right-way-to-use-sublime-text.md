![Sublime Text](/assets/images/sublime.png)

After having used sublime text for about 2 years the wrong way, I have finally learnt my lesson. I am going around the internet looking for ways to be more productive with Sublime Text.

Sublime Text is a swiss army knife with all forms of tips and tricks up it's sleeve. These include but are not limited to keyboard shortcuts, creating projects and code snippets.

I will keep listing down interesting things I find so this blog will be updated regularly for a few days. Remember to try out these tricks hands on as you read through them else they won't get registered in your mind.

So let's get started!

1. **Next Occurance of a word** `cmd + d` (Mac) \| `ctrl + d` (PC)

2. **Multi-cursor** `cmd + Left moust click` \| `ctrl + Left moust click`

3. **Column selection** `alt + left click drag` \| `shift + right click drag`

4. **Split selection into lines** `cmd + shift + L` \| `ctrl + shift + L`

5. **Move cursor to beginning of line** `cmd + left arrow` \| `home`

6. **Wrap selection with html tag** `ctrl + shift + w` \| `alt + shift + w`

7. **Move line vertically** `cmd + ctrl + arrow` \| `ctrl + shift + arrow`

8. **Duplicate Line** `cmd + shift + D` \| `ctrl + shift + D`

9. **Delete Line** `ctrl + shift + K` \| `ctrl + shift + K`

10. **Indent line** `cmd + [ or ]` \| `ctrl + [ or ]` (Also `Edit -> Line -> Reindent` for indentation of selection)

11. **Paste & Indent** `cmd + shift + V` \| `ctrl + shift + V` (Very very useful!)

Again, do try all this out by yourself!

**Cheers!**
