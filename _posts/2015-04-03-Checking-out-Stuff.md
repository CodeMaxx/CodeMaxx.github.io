## <center> So this should work </center>

First blog post. What should I write. <br/>
Let me introduce myself. I am **Akash Trehan** a.k.a. **CodeMaxx**. I am a first year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at IIT Bombay.

I've made this blog to write about what I code, my experience and other interesting stuff related to programming. If you are programming enthusiast like me you'll find this place amazing!
