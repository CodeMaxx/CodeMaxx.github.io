[Wptview](https://github.com/mozilla/wptview/) is a project which was started under [Mozilla's Quarter of Contribution](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution/November_2015). I have not spent much time on this project. I have a couple of contributions in it though.

A short description of [My Pull Requests](https://github.com/mozilla/wptview/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3ACodeMaxx) in wptview:

1. [PR #47](https://github.com/mozilla/wptview/pull/47)(**Merged**) - Incorporated filter objects to a single JSON object. This was my first encounter with AngularJS and I loved it. It makes things so much easier and reduces the amount of code as compared to the same thing  done in jQuery or JavaScript. I recommend using AngularJS in web projects.

2. [PR #82](https://github.com/mozilla/wptview/pull/82)(**Merged**) - Added an error message panel at the bottom of the page for a neat view of the errors. The commits from this PR were moved to [PR #95](https://github.com/mozilla/wptview/pull/95).

This project is under developement. Contact [@martiansideofthemoon](https://github.com/martiansideofthemoon) if you would like to work on this.
