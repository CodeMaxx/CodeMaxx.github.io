<center>A Python library for symbolic mathematics.</center>

[SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) is a well developed library with great support for various mathematical manipulations required in the field of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science. Being completely in python its a little slow and hence the project [SymEngine](https://codemaxx.github.io/SymEngine/) is being developed to act as a fast core for SymPy. I don't have a lot of contribution in this project but I have read through some of its code which has been helpful in developing features for SymEngine.

A short description of [My Pull Requests](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pulls/CodeMaxx) in SymPy:

1. [PR #10714](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10714)(**Unmerged**) - Added complete functionality for Inverse hyperbolic function `acsch`.Added Tests.

2. [PR #10721](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10721)(**Merged**) - Fixed typo in documentation of `asech` function.

3. [Issue #10717](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/10717)(**Open**) - Issue about missing `acsch` function which I fix in [PR #10714](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10714).
