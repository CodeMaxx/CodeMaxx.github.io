[CSec](https://www.facebook.com/groups/csec.iitb/) is the cybersecurity club of IIT Bombay started by me a few months ago. I have two aims in mind for the club:

- To spread awareness about various technical/non-technical stuff related Computer Security
- To build some strong teams for Capture the Flag competitions

Although the school year remains very buzy, I try to give as much time as possible towards this end. Aligned with this goal, I decided to start a vodcast series on Binary Exploitation with help from the legendary Web & Coding Club.

Presenting the first video from the series (This is my debut video; go easy on me :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) -

Liked it ??? Didn't like it ????? Let me know!

Constructive criticism is much appreciated.

**Cheers!**
