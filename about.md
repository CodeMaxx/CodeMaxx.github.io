`Hello World!`

I'm Akash Trehan, a Second Year Computer Science Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I hail from Ferozepur, Punjab. I am very enthusiastic about Software Developement and Network & Information Security. I always keep myself buzy in Open Source Projects. Lately I have also been trying my hand at Capture the Flag problems and I'm loving it.

I like tinkering with electronic circuits as well as computer softwares. I have built robotic vehicles for Line Follower and Obstacle Crossing comptetions here at IIT.

I like to try out new things. In my free time I like listening to music, solving Rubik's cube, watching TV Series, playing online games and doing lots of other random stuff :P . I love Punjabi food :D

I always keep experimenting with things and firmly believe that it is the only way to become good at them.

I am starting this blog to write about my experiences, my projects, and other interesting stuff. I will mostly be updating the [Write-ups](../writeups) section though.
