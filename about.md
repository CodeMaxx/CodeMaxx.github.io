`Hello World!`

I'm Akash Trehan, a Second Year Computer Science Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I hail from Ferozepur, Punjab. I am very enthusiastic about Cyber Security and Software Developement. I always keep myself buzy in Open Source Projects and Capture the Flag competitions.
I am self-taught in the field of Information Security in which I want to research later in my life.

I like tinkering with electronic circuits as well as computer softwares. I have built robotic vehicles for Line Follower and Obstacle Crossing comptetions here at IIT. I've also released a couple of applications and a website for use inside the institute.

I like to try out new things. In my free time I like listening to music, solving Rubik's cube, watching TV Series, playing online games and doing lots of other random stuff :P . I love Punjabi food :D

I always keep experimenting with things and firmly believe that it is the only way to become good at them.

I'm a convener of the Web Team and also the Founder and Manager of [Cyber Security Club at IIT](https://www.facebook.com/groups/csec.iitb).

I am starting this blog to write about my experiences, my projects, and other interesting stuff. I will mostly be updating the [Write-ups](../writeups) section though.
