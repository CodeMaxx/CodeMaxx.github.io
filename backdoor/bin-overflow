## Write-up

<!-- I saw two suspicious things on the page - a QR code and a 90% complete progress bar. I went to the source code and saw the progress bar was hardcoded to remain at 90% and hence it is just a distraction.

Then I read the QR code using an online utility. Seach for `QR Code decoder` decoder on `Google`. You'll find plenty of them. I used <https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx>

This is what I got.

![Decoded QR](/assets/images/infosecInstin00b/decoded_qr3.png)

This surely looks like `Morse Code`. I used <https://morsecode.scphillips.com/translator.html> to convert this to ascii text.
I got `INFOSECFLAGISMORSING`.

This gives away the flag.
